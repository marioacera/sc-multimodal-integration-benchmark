# Benchmark framework & mBDRC generation
This repository contains the code for reproducibility of results in our publication: "Systematic evaluation of single-cell multimodal data integration for comprehensive human reference atlas". Using the human kidney as a model for a complex tissue, we generated a unique benchmarking dataset for the multimodal characterization of renal cortex by integrating 3' and 5' scRNA-seq, with joint snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data, encompassing 119,744 high-quality nuclei/cells from 18 donors. To align cell identities across datasets and enable consistent comparison, we developed scOMM ([single-cell Omics Multimodal Mapping](https://github.com/mereulab/scOMM)), an interpretable machine learning tool specifically designed for reference-based cell-type classification.
